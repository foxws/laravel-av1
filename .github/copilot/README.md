# AI Context Documentation

This directory contains documentation files created to provide context for AI assistants (like GitHub Copilot) working on this codebase.

## Files

- **ARCHITECTURE.md** - Package structure and design overview
- **AV1_ENCODING_IMPLEMENTATION.md** - Implementation details for AV1 encoding features
- **FFMPEG_ENCODING.md** - FFmpeg usage examples and hardware acceleration guide
- **SIMPLIFIED_API.md** - Simplified API documentation (v2.0)
- **TEST_SUITE_COMPLETION_REPORT.md** - Comprehensive test suite summary
- **TESTING_QUICK_REFERENCE.md** - Quick reference for test structure

## Purpose

These files help AI assistants understand:

- How the package is structured
- What features are implemented
- How to use various APIs
- What tests exist and what they cover

They are not meant for end users - see the main [README.md](../../README.md) for user documentation.
